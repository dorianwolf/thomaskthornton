# Hallo! Hi! Ciao! Salut!
{: .title}

I am your reliable partner for translations and adaptations from or into German as well as line- and copyediting plus proofreading work. With over 20 years of experience, I am intimately familiar with all areas of art and culture and cover virtually the entire range of industry sectors.
No source text is too short or too long, too idiomatic or too theoretical. My work is marked by my passion for language, faithfulness to the content and style of a text, and strict adherence even to extremely tight deadlines. For a general overview of my fields of expertise, please go to [Services](/services).
