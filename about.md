## CAREER STAGES

After majoring in German Literature and History at the University of Freiburg in Germany I earned a Ph.D. in German Language and Literature from the University of California, Santa Barbara and subsequently was Assistant Professor at Columbia University and Hunter College in New York. Later I changed careers to work in book publishing as executive editor (Suhrkamp Publishers New York, Fromm International) and also worked as a translator and writer. I have been a freelancer since 2005.
